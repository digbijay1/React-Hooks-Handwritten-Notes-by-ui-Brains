            Copmponent Interaction
            
Basic Example
se3nd data from p[arent to  immeediate choild and frrom child to p[arent


To send data from parent to child is easy i.e directly send the props and if u try to send data from  child to parent it is bit tricky


Intrermideate level
-----------------------
there are 2 input boxes whatever you try to send to parent to child u can send and from child u can send data to parernt also.
check this code again bit confused




Advance level

---------
send clent to severre and from server to client


means the clint want tto send the data to server and server warnt to sned the data to client itself but there si no parent child realationsships so the 



very very imp reamm,ber it
the coppmponrnt interacxtion should br in the pareant child inmteraction,twqoi comp0onrnet at same level cant intearct with them,.,


the client--->send data to app.js  -->then from app.js send the data to client
and vise versa bcoz app. js is the parent of both the compoainentas


check this code again bit confused

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
conectx api
props drillign
lifecycle




props dreilling
--------------------------
if you wantt to send datra from componentt A to component c.
App to
compo A to
Compod B to
Compo c 

i.e called props drilling

But it is noty good


Life cycle
---------------------
Digital watch


useEffect->componenet did mount(when component is successfully loaded to dom)
useEffecxt->componenty wILLuNMOUNT(WHEN THE COMPONENET IS REMOVED FROM DOM)



SYNTAX
===========================
useEffect(()=>{
return ()=>{
//componentWillUnmount
      }
   });


everytime is when the state will be changed it loads every time whenever state change


useContext
================
i can directyly passa the data to the required childd not sending data to each level
check this code agaiun

one is provider and one is consumer
========================
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                                              react with http and axios
         useEffect=
         the useefect get executyed whenever the com,pone tis susccefully loaded in dom
         if you dont use the empty array in useeeffect thhe api wwill fetcha t every time so pls use react hooks with empty array depedency
